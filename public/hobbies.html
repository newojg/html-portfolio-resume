    <h2>Weightlifting / Gym</h2>

    <p>One of my favourite hobbies is going to the gym on a regular basis; firstly it's relatively healthy depending
        on your technique while weightlifting and it's really fun. It's a rewarding experience to be disciplined enough
        to go to the gym multiple times per week, as it's beneficial to your mental and physical health.

    <h2>Reading</h2>

    <p>Reading a good book is one of my favourite things to do, as it can be quite entertaining and
        educational, depending on what you like to read. I prefer reading self-improvement books, as they are
        great for improving your daily life and productivity. If you are looking for a brilliant self-improvement book, 
        I would suggest reading Atomic Habits by James Clear and Can't Hurt Me by David Goggins. These are two contrasting books in a sense, but
        they are both great for changing your life for the better.

    <h2>Listening to Podcasts/Music</h2>

    <p>Listening to podcasts is one of the best activities you can do in your free time, as they
        are entertaining and rich in information. I usually only listen to one podcast really, and that is the Huberman Lab
        Podcast by Dr. Andrew Huberman. This podcast covers a wide range of areas from optimising your sleep to how to leverage your dopamine
        system to become more productive. Overall I would recommend the Huberman podcast if you are looking for something to listen to which is based on science.
